# CS305_Mod05
My CS305 Module 05 assigment repository

For this project, I'm creating an app that reads a number to determine whether it is even or add, but no matter what number you type in, it just outputs the Preamble to the United States Constitution

I'm also using an MIT license because it is one of the most permissive licenses out there and grants developers the most freedom
